# Oteemo Charts Repository

This is the Oteemo helm charts repository.

### How It Works

GitHub Pages points to the `gh-pages` branch so anything pushed to that branch will be publicly available. We are using a couple github actions to automate testing and deployment of charts. It is based off the example [here](https://github.com/helm/charts-repo-actions-demo).

### Process to add a chart to the repository

1. Create a branch for your new chart
1. Initialize new chart in the `charts` directory with `helm create mychart` or by copying in your work from outside
1. After chart development is done, run (at minimum) `helm lint mychart/` to validate yaml and templates
1. Don't forget to bump your chart version (if needed)
1. Create a pull request with the new chart or updates
1. Once the PR is approved, the automation will publish the chart to our repository

### Adding the chart Repository

`helm repo add oteemocharts https://oteemo.github.io/charts`
